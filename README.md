# flyback
A simple python backup script (rsync with a list of files to be excluded). It allows you to populate this list interactively, for all files/directories larger than a specified threshold. This way you don't end up copying large unnecessary files (like .cache).

* requires python 3.4 or higher

Just set the parameters at the top and run it
